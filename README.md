The Calculator Application is a Java-based program designed to perform both basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced functions like exponentiation, square root calculations, and trigonometric evaluations. It features a modular design for easy maintenance and reusability, alongside robust error handling for edge cases such as division by zero or invalid inputs. The application includes a comprehensive set of JUnit test cases to ensure the accuracy and reliability of its operations. This console-based tool is ideal for educational and practical use, with potential for future enhancements like a graphical user interface (GUI) and support for advanced scientific computations.
